# Tekken-7-primitive-mod-manager
So...
This program is what happens when person who knows little python asks chatGPT to write entire program for them.
I've wrote max 10 lines and glued everything together.
Now it only works on linux.

## Usage
```python ./TMMTEST-with-multi.py (path to mod to add)```

## How it's working
It just copies and pastes mods to the proper folders.
It supports not only .pak mods that are stored in ```~mods``` but also applies .csv files for [TKDataPatcher](https://tekkenmods.com/mod/2301/tkdatapatcher) support (Right now .csv files are not managable via this script)

## Contribution
if you are someone with more python experience feel free to do whatever you want with this. If you have any idea write it in issues. (I don't promise anything)
